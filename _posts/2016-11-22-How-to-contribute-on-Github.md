This is an answer that I gave on quora where a tech enthusiast has asked regarding how one should contribute on github.

<!-- more -->

After 2010 with the rise of github I rarely see programmers re-inventing the wheel as there lots and lots of open source tools available and I have done the same as I believe in the dev. community has done some awesome work I time to time explore projects on github and learn from it and/or use it at my work, so it is obvious that I should give back of the little knowledge I have to the community and as an attempt of that I try to contribute to open source projects. In this answer I try to explain how I do that. If you like it please upvote it.

Happy Contributing!
